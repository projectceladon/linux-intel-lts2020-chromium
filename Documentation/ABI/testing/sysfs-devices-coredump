Description:
		The /sys/devices/.../coredump_disabled attribute can be used by

		for a device. The userspace can write 0/1 to it to control
		enabling/disabling of devcoredump for that particular device.

		driver which implements the .coredump() callback. The attribute
		is readable and writeable.

		Available when CONFIG_DEV_COREDUMP is enabled.
